## Getting start
  - [Software installation](psana-cctbx-install): steps for performing the installation of the software pipeline.
  - Build tests: In progress

## Data processing
  - [Calibration](cspad_calib): the necessary steps to calibrate the detector prior to analysing data.
  - [Discovery](disc-refine): using the initial calibration, spot finding and integration is performed to determine a crystal structure. Further refinement and calibration is performed here, until convergence has been reached.
  - [Batch](batch): perform large scale parallel processing and refinement of the data using the optimised parameters from the previous stages.
