## Getting start
  - Software installation
  - Testing build

## Data processing
  - [Calibration](url): the necessary steps to calibrate the detector prior to analysing data.
  - [Discovery](url): using the initial calibration, spot finding and integration is performed to determine a crystal structure. Further refinement and calibration is performed here, until convergence has been reached.
  - [Batch](url): perform large scale parallel processing and refinement of the data using the optimised parameters from the previous stages.
